AngularJS was the first front-end framework that I ever learned. I built my first AngularJS project two years ago and have used this framework for personal and professional projects many times since. One of the things that immediately blew my mind about AngularJS is how easy it is to bind controller data to the DOM and vice-versa uisng simple directives. This feature is called two-way data binding. While I have enjoyed the benefits of Angular's two-way data binding in my projects, it has always felt like magic to me and I never took the time to dig into how it works. Recently,  I decided to implement my own basic version of two-way data binding using vanilla js. It turns out that it's fairly straightforward. No magic involved!
