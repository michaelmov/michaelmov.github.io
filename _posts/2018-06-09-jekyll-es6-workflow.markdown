Everyone knows that Webpack is awesome for bundling your JavaScript projects. It has powerful features and is very customizeable. Likewise, Jekyll is an excellent static site generator.

The step below are outline the process if integrating Webpack into a Jekyll site so that you can bundle ES6 into ES5.


### Create a directory for JavaScript source files

### Add webpack.config.js

### Update package.json
