![About Michael Movsesov]({{site.url}}/assets/images/about-michael-movsesov.png "About Michael Movsesov")

> My Name is Michael. I am a front-end developer and designer with a passion for crafting delightful experiences on the web.

Most of my days are spent coding, designing, experimenting with new technologies and sharing what I learn on this blog.

When I am not writing code or designing, I enjoy running, photography, the great outdoors of PNW, spending time with my wife + our two cats [Pixie and Linux](https://www.instagram.com/pixie.and.linux/) , and attempting to craft a perfect latte.
