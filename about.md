> My Name is Michael. I am a front-end developer with a passion for crafting delightful experiences on the web.

With a background in UI design and photography, I take pride in creating modern websites and web apps that not only work, but also look great. Most of my days are spent coding, designing, experimenting with new technologies and sharing what I learn on this blog.
